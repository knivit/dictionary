<h1>Could</h1>

<p>&quot;Could&quot; is used to express possibility or past ability as well as to make suggestions and requests. &quot;Could&quot; is also commonly used in <a href="../conditional/conditionalintro.html">conditional</a> sentences as the conditional form of &quot;can.&quot;</p>
<div class="ex">
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extreme rain <strong>could</strong> cause the river to flood the city. <em class="comment">possibility</em></li>

"Could not" suggests that it is impossible for something to happen. "Might not" suggests you do not know if something happens. </p>
