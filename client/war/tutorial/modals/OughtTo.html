<h1>Ought To</h1>

<p>&quot;Ought to&quot; is used to advise or make recommendations. &quot;Ought to&quot; also expresses assumption or
   expectation as well as strong probability, often with the idea that something is deserved. &quot;Ought not&quot; (without
   &quot;to&quot;) is used to advise against doing something, although Americans prefer the less formal forms &quot;should
   not&quot; or &quot;had better not.&quot;
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You <strong>ought to</strong> stop smoking. <em class="comment">recommendation</em></li>
  <li>Jim <strong>ought to</strong> get the promotion. <em class="comment">It is expected because he deserves it.</em> </li>
  <li>This stock <strong>ought to</strong> increase in value. <em class="comment">probability</em></li>
  <li>Mark <strong>ought not</strong> drink so much. <em class="comment">advice against something (notice there is no &quot;to&quot;)</em></li>
</ul>

          Remember that &quot;ought to&quot; loses the &quot;to&quot; in the negative. Instead of &quot;ought not to,&quot; we say &quot;ought not.&quot; &quot;Ought not&quot; is more commonly used in British English. Americans prefer &quot;should not.&quot; </p>
