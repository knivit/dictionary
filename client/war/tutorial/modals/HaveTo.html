        That must not have been the right restaurant. I guess there was another one around there somewhere. </p>

    <td><p><strong>REMEMBER: "Do not have to" vs. "Must not" </strong><br>
"Do not have to" suggests that someone is not required to do something. "Must not" suggests that you are prohibited from doing something.</p>

          <p>Examples:</p>

            <li>You <strong>don't have to</strong> eat that. <em class="comment">You can if you want to, but it is not necessary.</em></li>
