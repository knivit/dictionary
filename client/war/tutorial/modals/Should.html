<h1>Should</h1>

<p>&quot;Should&quot; is most commonly used to make recommendations or give advice. It can also be used to express
   obligation as well as expectation.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you go to Berlin, you <strong>should</strong> visit the palaces in Potsdam. <em class="comment">recommendation</em></li>
  <li>You <strong>should</strong> focus more on your family and less on work. <em class="comment">advice</em></li>
  <li>I really <strong>should</strong> be in the office by 7:00 AM. <em class="comment">obligation</em></li>
  <li>By now, they <strong>should</strong> already be in Dubai. <em class="comment">expectation</em></li>
</ul>
