<h1>Shall</h1>

<p>&quot;Shall&quot; is used to indicate future action. It is most commonly used in sentences with &quot;I&quot; or &quot;
   we,&quot; and is often found in suggestions, such as &quot;Shall we go?&quot; &quot;Shall&quot; is also frequently used
   in promises or voluntary actions. In formal English, the use of &quot;shall&quot; to describe future events often
   expresses inevitability or predestination. &quot;Shall&quot; is much more commonly heard in British English than in
   American English; Americans prefer to use other forms, although they do sometimes use &quot;shall&quot; in suggestions
   or formalized language.
