<h1>Must</h1>

<p>&quot;Must&quot; is most commonly used to express certainty. It can also be used to express necessity or strong
   recommendation, although native speakers prefer the more flexible form &quot;have to.&quot; &quot;Must not&quot; can be
   used to prohibit actions, but this sounds very severe; speakers prefer to use softer modal verbs such as &quot;should
   not&quot; or &quot;ought not&quot; to dissuade rather than prohibit.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This <strong>must</strong> be the right address! <em class="comment">certainty</em></li>
  <li>Students <strong>must</strong> pass an entrance examination to study at this school. <em class="comment">necessity</em></li>
  <li>You <strong>must</strong> take some medicine for that cough. <em class="comment">strong recommendation</em></li>
  <li>Jenny, you <strong>must</strong> not play in the street! <em class="comment">prohibition</em> </li>
</ul>
