<h3>What are Modal Verbs? </h3>
<p>Modal verbs are special verbs which behave very differently from normal verbs. Here are some important differences:</p>
<p>1. Modal verbs do not take "-s" in the third person. </p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li> He can&nbsp; speak Chinese.</li>
  <li>She should&nbsp; be here by 9:00. </li>
</ul>

<p>2. You use "not" to make modal verbs negative, even in Simple Present and Simple Past. </p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>He should not be late.</li>
  <li>They might not come to the party. </li>
</ul>

<p>3. Many modal verbs cannot be used in the past tenses or the future tenses. </p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li> He will can  go with us. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>She musted  study very hard. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we have included some expressions which are not modal verbs including
   <strong>had better</strong>, <strong>have to, </strong> and <strong>have got to</strong>. These expressions are closely
   related to modals in meaning and are often interchanged with them.
