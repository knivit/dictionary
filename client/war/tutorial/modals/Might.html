<h1>Might</h1>

<p>&quot;Might&quot; is most commonly used to express possibility. It is also often used in 
   <a href="ConditionalIntro.html">conditional</a> sentences. English speakers can also use &quot;might&quot; to make
   suggestions or requests, although this is less common in American English.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your purse <strong>might</strong> be in the living room. <em class="comment">possibility</em></li>
  <li>If I didn't have to work, I <strong>might</strong> go with you. <em class="comment">conditional</em></li>
  <li>You <strong>might</strong> visit the botanical gardens during your visit. <em class="comment">suggestion</em></li>
  <li><strong>Might</strong> I borrow your pen? <em class="comment">request</em></li>
</ul>
