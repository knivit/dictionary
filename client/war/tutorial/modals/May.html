<h1>May</h1>

<p>&quot;May&quot; is most commonly used to express possibility. It can also be used to give or request permission, although this usage is becoming less common.</p>
<div class="ex">
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cheryl <strong>may</strong> be at home, or perhaps at work. <em class="comment">possibility</em></li>
      <li>Johnny, you <strong>may</strong> leave the table when you have finished your dinner. <em class="comment">give permission</em></li>
      <li><strong>May</strong> I use your bathroom? <em class="comment">request permission </em> </li>
      </ul>
</div>
