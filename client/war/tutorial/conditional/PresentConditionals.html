<h1>Present Conditionals</h1>

<h2>Present Real Conditional</h2>
<h3>FORM</h3>
<p>[If / When ... Simple Present ..., ... Simple Present ...]</p>
<p>[... Simple Present ... if / when ... Simple Present ...]</p>

<h3>USE</h3>
<p>The Present Real Conditional is used to talk about what you normally do in real-life situations.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If I <strong>go</strong> to a friend's house for dinner, I usually <strong>take</strong> a bottle of wine or some flowers.</li>
  <li>When I <strong>have</strong> a day off from work, I often <strong>go</strong> to the beach.</li>
  <li>If the weather <strong>is</strong> nice, she <strong>walks</strong> to work.</li>
  <li>Jerry <strong>helps</strong> me with my homework when he <strong>has</strong> time.</li>
  <li>I <strong>read</strong> if there <strong>is</strong> nothing on TV.</li>
  <li>A: What <strong>do you do</strong> when it <strong>rains</strong>?<br>
      B: I <strong>stay</strong> at home.</li>
  <li>A: Where <strong>do you stay</strong> if you <strong>go</strong> to Sydney?<br>
      B: I <strong>stay</strong> with my friends near the harbor.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>IMPORTANT If / When</h3>
<p>Both &quot;if&quot; and &quot;when&quot; are used in the Present Real Conditional. Using &quot;if&quot; suggests that something happens less frequently. Using &quot;when&quot; suggests that something happens regularly.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>When</strong> I have a day off from work, I usually go to the beach.<br>
    <em class="comment">I regularly have days off from work.</em>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If</strong> I have a day off from work, I usually go to the beach.<br>
    <em class="comment">I rarely have days off from work.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Present Unreal Conditional<a name="pruc"></a></h2>
<h3>FORM</h3>
<p>[If ... Simple Past ..., ... would + verb ...]</p>
<p>[... would + verb ... if ... Simple Past ...] </p>
<h3>USE</h3>
<p>The Present Unreal Conditional is used to talk about what you would generally do in imaginary situations.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If I <strong>owned</strong> a car, I <strong>would drive</strong> to work. But I don't own a car.</li>
  <li>She <strong>would travel</strong> around the world if she <strong>had</strong> more money. But she doesn't have much money.</li>
  <li>I <strong>would read</strong> more if I <strong>didn't watch </strong> so much TV.</li>
  <li>Mary <strong>would move</strong> to Japan if she <strong>spoke</strong> Japanese.</li>
  <li>If they <strong>worked</strong> harder, they <strong>would earn</strong> more money.</li>
  <li>A: What <strong>would</strong> you <strong>do</strong> if you <strong>won</strong> the lottery?<br>
      B: I <strong>would buy</strong> a house.</li>
  <li>A: Where <strong>would</strong> you <strong>live</strong> if you <strong>moved</strong> to the U.S.?<br>
      B: I <strong>would live</strong> in Seattle.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>EXCEPTION If I were ...</h3>
<p>In the Present Unreal Conditional, the form &quot;was&quot; is not considered grammatically correct. In written English
   or in testing situations, you should always use &quot;were.&quot; However, in everyday conversation, &quot;was&quot; is
   often used.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If he <strong>were</strong> French, he would live in Paris.</li>
  <li>If she <strong>were</strong> rich, she would buy a yacht.</li>
  <li>I would play basketball if I <strong>were</strong> taller.</li>
  <li>I would buy that computer if it <strong>were</strong> cheaper.</li>
  <li>I would buy that computer if it <strong>was</strong> cheaper.
    <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em>
    <em class="comment">(But often said in conversation.)</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>IMPORTANT Only use &quot;If&quot;</h3>
Only the word &quot;if&quot; is used with the Present Unreal Conditional because you are discussing imaginary situations.
&quot;When&quot; cannot be used.
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I would buy that computer <strong>when</strong> it were cheaper. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>I would buy that computer <strong>if</strong> it were cheaper. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>EXCEPTION Conditional with Modal Verbs</h3>
<p>There are some special conditional forms for modal verbs in English:</p>
<p><strong>would + can = could</strong></p>
<p><strong>would + shall = should</strong></p>
<p><strong>would + may = might</strong></p>
<p>The words &quot;can,&quot; &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;may&quot; cannot be used with &quot;would.&quot; Instead, they 
   must be used in these special forms.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If I went to Egypt, I <strong>would can</strong> learn Arabic. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>If I went to Egypt, I <strong>could</strong> learn Arabic. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If she had time, she <strong>would may</strong> go to the party. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>If she had time, she <strong>might</strong> go to the party. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The words &quot;could,&quot; should,&quot; &quot;might&quot; and &quot;ought to&quot; include conditional, so you cannot 
   combine them with &quot;would.&quot;
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If I had more time, I <strong>would could</strong> exercise after work. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>If I had more time, I <strong>could</strong> exercise after work. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If he invited you, you really <strong>would should</strong> go. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>If he invited you, you really <strong>should</strong> go. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>
