<h1>Past Conditionals</h1>

<h2>Past Real Conditional</h2>
<h3>FORM</h3>
<p>[If / When ... Simple Past ..., ... Simple Past ...]</p>
<p>[... Simple Past... if / when ... Simple Past ...] </p>
<h3>USE</h3>
<p>The Past Real Conditional describes what you used to do in particular real-life situations. It suggests that your habits
   have changed and you do not usually do these things today.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If I <strong>went</strong> to a friend's house for dinner, I usually <strong>took</strong> a bottle of wine or some
      flowers. I don't do that anymore.
  </li>
  <li>When I <strong>had</strong> a day off from work, I often <strong>went</strong> to the beach. Now, I never get time off.</li>
  <li>If the weather <strong>was</strong> nice, she often <strong>walked</strong> to work. Now, she usually drives.</li>
  <li>Jerry always <strong>helped</strong> me with my homework when he <strong>had</strong> time. But he doesn't do that anymore.</li>
  <li>A: What <strong>did</strong> you usually <strong>do</strong> when it <strong>rained</strong>?<br>
      B: I usually <strong>stayed</strong> at home.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>IMPORTANT Used to</h3>
<p>The form &quot;<a href="UsedTo.html">used to</a>&quot; expresses the idea that something was an old habit that stopped
   in the past. This form is commonly used in Past Real Conditional sentences to emphasize that something was a habit.
   The examples below have the same meaning as the examples above.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If I went to a friend's house for dinner, I <strong>used to take</strong> a bottle of wine or some flowers. I don't do that anymore.</li>
  <li>When I had a day off from work, I <strong>used to go</strong> to the beach. Now, I never get time off.</li>
  <li>If the weather was nice, she <strong>used to walk</strong> to work. Now, she usually drives.</li>
  <li>Jerry <strong>used to help</strong> me with my homework when he had time. But he doesn't do that anymore.</li>
  <li>A: What <strong>did</strong> you usually <strong>do</strong> when it rained?<br>
      B: I <strong>used to stay</strong> at home.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>IMPORTANT If / When</h3>
<p>Both &quot;if&quot; and &quot;when&quot; are used in the Past Real Conditional. Using &quot;if&quot; suggests that
   something happened less frequently. Using &quot;when&quot; suggests that something happened regularly.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>When</strong> I had a day off from work, I usually went to the beach.<br>
    <em class="comment">I regularly had days off from work.</em>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If</strong> I had a day off from work, I usually went to the beach.<br>
    <em class="comment">I rarely had days off from work.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Past Unreal Conditional</h2>
<h3>FORM</h3>
<p>[If ... Past Perfect ..., ... would have + past participle ... ]</p>
<p>[... would have + past participle ... if ... Past Perfect ...]</p>
<h3>USE</h3>
<p>The Past Unreal Conditional is used to talk about imaginary situations in the past. You can describe what you would have
   done differently or how something could have happened differently if circumstances had been different.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If I <strong>had owned </strong> a car, I <strong>would have driven</strong> to work. But I didn't own one, so I took the bus.</li>
  <li>She <strong>would have traveled</strong> around the world if she <strong>had had </strong> more money. But she didn't
      have much money, so she never traveled.
  </li>
  <li>I <strong>would have read</strong> more as a child if I <strong>hadn't watched </strong> so much TV. Unfortunately,
      I did watch a lot of TV, so I never read for entertainment.
  </li>
  <li>Mary <strong>would have gotten</strong> the job and <strong>moved</strong> to Japan if she <strong>had studied</strong>
      Japanese in school instead of French.
  </li>
  <li>If Jack <strong>had worked</strong> harder, he <strong>would have earned</strong> more money. Unfortunately, he was lazy
      and he didn't earn much.
  </li>
  <li>A: What <strong>would</strong> you <strong>have done</strong> if you <strong>had won</strong> the lottery last week?<br>
      B: I <strong>would have bought</strong> a house.</li>
  <li>A: What city <strong>would</strong> you <strong>have chosen</strong> if you <strong>had decided</strong> to move to the United States?<br>
      B: I <strong>would have chosen</strong> Seattle.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>IMPORTANT Only use &quot;If&quot;</h3>
<p>Only the word &quot;if&quot; is used with the Past Unreal Conditional because you are discussing imaginary situations.
   &quot;When&quot; cannot be used.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I would have bought that computer <strong>when</strong> it had been cheaper. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>I would have bought that computer <strong>if</strong> it had been cheaper. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>EXCEPTION Conditional with Modal Verbs</h3>
<p> There are some special conditional forms for modal verbs in English:</p>
<p><strong>would have + can = could have</strong></p>
<p><strong>would have + shall = should have</strong></p>
<p><strong>would have + may = might have</strong></p>
<p>The words &quot;can,&quot; &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;may&quot; cannot be used with &quot;would have.&quot; Instead,
   they must be used in these special forms.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If I had gone to Egypt, I <strong>could have learned</strong> Arabic.</li>
  <li>If she had had time, she <strong>might have gone</strong> to the party.</li>
</ul>

<p>The words &quot;could,&quot; should,&quot; &quot;might&quot; and &quot;ought to&quot; include Conditional, so you cannot
   combine them with &quot;would have.&quot;
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If I had had more time, I <strong>could have exercised</strong> after work.</li>
  <li>If he had invited you, you <strong>might have gone</strong>.</li>
</ul>
