<h1>Mixed Conditionals</h1>

<p>Those of you who have been following the Conditional Tutorial should now be familiar with present, past and future conditional verb forms. Sometimes Unreal Conditional sentences are mixed. This means that the time in the if-clause is not the same as the time in the result. Study the examples below to learn how to mix conditional verb forms like a native speaker.</p>
<p style="color:#009700;">Verbs in green are in the Present Unreal Conditional.</p>
<p style="color:#FF0000;">Verbs in red are in the Past Unreal Conditional.</p>
<p style="color:#bb00bb;">Verbs in purple are in the Future Unreal Conditional.</p>
