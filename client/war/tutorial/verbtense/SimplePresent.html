    a person often forgets or usually does not do.

<ul>
  <li>I <strong>play</strong> tennis.</li>
  <li>She <strong>does not play</strong> tennis.</li>

<p>The Simple Present can also indicate  the speaker believes that a fact was true before, is true now,
   and will be true in the future. It is not important if the speaker is correct about the fact. It is
   used to make generalizations about people or things.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cats <strong>like</strong> milk.</li>
  <li>Birds <strong>do not like</strong> milk.</li>
  <li><strong>Do</strong> pigs <strong>like</strong> milk?</li>
