<h3>USE 1 Duration from the Past Until Now</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/PresentPerfectContinuous.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>We use the Present Perfect Continuous to show that something started in the past and has continued up until now. &quot;
   For five minutes,&quot; &quot;for two weeks,&quot; and &quot;since Tuesday&quot; are all durations which can be used with
   the Present Perfect Continuous.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They <strong>have been talking</strong> for the last hour.</li>
  <li>She <strong>has been working</strong> at that company for three years.</li>
  <li>What <strong>have</strong> you <strong>been doing</strong> for the last 30 minutes? </li>
  <li>James <strong>has been teaching</strong> at the university since June.</li>
  <li>We <strong>have been waiting </strong> here for over two hours! </li>
  <li>Why <strong>has</strong> Nancy <strong>not been taking</strong> her medicine for the last three days?</li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 2 Recently, Lately</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/PresentPerfectContinuous.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also use the Present Perfect Continuous WITHOUT a duration such as &quot;for two weeks.&quot; Without the duration,
   the tense has a more general meaning of &quot;lately.&quot; We often use the words &quot;lately&quot; or &quot;recently&quot;
   to emphasize this meaning.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Recently, I <strong>have been feeling</strong> really tired.</li>
  <li>She <strong>has been watching</strong> too much television lately.</li>
  <li><strong>Have</strong> you <strong>been exercising</strong> lately? </li>
  <li>Mary <strong>has been feeling</strong> a little depressed.</li>
  <li>Lisa <strong>has not been practicing</strong> her English. </li>
  <li>What <strong>have</strong> you <strong>been doing</strong>? </li>
</ul>

<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
<p>Remember that the Present Perfect Continuous has the meaning of &quot;lately&quot; or &quot;recently.&quot; If you use the
   Present Perfect Continuous in a question such as &quot;Have you been feeling alright?&quot;, it can suggest that the person
   looks sick or unhealthy. A question such as &quot;Have you been smoking?&quot; can suggest that you  smell the smoke on the person.
   Using this tense in a question suggests you can see, smell, hear or feel the results of the action. It is possible to insult
   someone by using this tense incorrectly.
</p>
<h3>REMEMBER Non-Continuous Verbs/ Mixed Verbs</h3>
<p>It is important to remember that <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Non-Continuous Verbs</a> cannot be used in
   any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Mixed Verbs</a>
   cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Present Perfect Continuous with these verbs, you must use
   <a href="PresentPerfect.html">Present Perfect</a>.

<ul>
  <li>Sam <strong>has been having</strong> his car for two years. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>

</ul>

<h3>ADVERB PLACEMENT</h3>
