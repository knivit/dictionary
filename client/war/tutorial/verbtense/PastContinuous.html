<h3>USE 1 Interrupted Action in the Past </h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/PastContinuous.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>Use the Past Continuous to indicate that a longer action in the past was interrupted. The interruption
   is usually a shorter action in the Simple Past. Remember this can be a real interruption or just an
   interruption in time.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>was watching</strong> TV when she called.</li>
  <li>When the phone rang, she <strong>was writing</strong> a letter.</li>
  <li>While we <strong>were having</strong> the picnic, it started to rain.</li>
  <li>What <strong>were</strong> you <strong>doing</strong> when the earthquake started? </li>
  <li>I <strong>was listening</strong> to my iPod, so I didn't hear the fire alarm. </li>
  <li>You <strong>were not listening</strong> to me when I told you to turn the oven off.</li>
  <li>While John <strong>was sleeping</strong> last night, someone stole his car.</li>
  <li>Sammy <strong>was waiting</strong> for us when we got off the plane. </li>
  <li>While  I <strong>was writing</strong> the email, the computer suddenly went off.</li>
  <li>A: What <strong>were</strong> you <strong>doing</strong> when you broke your leg?<br>
      B: I <strong>was snowboarding</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 2 Specific Time as an Interruption </h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/PastContinuous.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>In USE 1, described above, the Past Continuous is interrupted by a shorter action in the Simple Past.
   However, you can also use a specific time as an interruption.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Last night at 6 PM, I <strong>was eating</strong> dinner.</li>
  <li>At midnight, we <strong>were</strong> still <strong>driving</strong> through the desert.</li>
  <li>Yesterday at this time, I <strong>was sitting</strong> at my desk at work. </li>
</ul>

<h4>IMPORTANT</h4>
<p>In the Simple Past, a specific time is used to show when an action began or finished. In the Past Continuous,
   a specific time only interrupts the action.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Last night at 6 PM, I <strong>ate</strong> dinner.<br>
    <em class="comment">I started eating at 6 PM.</em>
  </li>
  <li>Last night at 6 PM, I <strong>was eating</strong> dinner.<br>
    <em class="comment">I started earlier;</em>
    <em class="comment"> and at 6 PM, I was in the process of eating dinner.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 3 Parallel Actions </h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/PastContinuousParallel.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>When you use the Past Continuous with two actions in the same sentence, it expresses the idea that both
   actions were happening at the same time. The actions are parallel.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>was studying</strong> while he <strong>was making</strong> dinner.</li>
  <li>While Ellen <strong>was reading</strong>, Tim <strong>was watching</strong> television.</li>
  <li><strong>Were</strong> you <strong>listening</strong> while he <strong>was talking</strong>? </li>
  <li>I <strong>wasn't paying</strong> attention while I <strong>was writing</strong> the letter, so I made several mistakes. </li>
  <li>What <strong>were</strong> you <strong>doing</strong> while you <strong>were waiting</strong>? </li>
  <li>Thomas <strong>wasn't working</strong>, and I <strong>wasn't working</strong> either. </li>
  <li>They <strong>were eating</strong> dinner, <strong>discussing</strong> their plans, and <strong>having</strong> a good time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 4 Atmosphere</h3>
<p>In English, we often use a series of parallel actions to describe the atmosphere at a particular time in the past.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When I walked into the office, several people <strong>were</strong> busily <strong>typing</strong>,
      some <strong>were talking</strong> on the phones, the boss <strong>was yelling</strong> directions,
      and customers <strong>were waiting</strong> to be helped. One customer <strong>was yelling</strong>
      at a secretary and <strong>waving</strong> his hands. Others <strong>were complaining</strong> to
      each other about the bad service.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 5 Repetition and Irritation with &quot;Always&quot; </h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/SimplePastHabit.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>The Past Continuous with words such as &quot;always&quot; or &quot;constantly&quot; expresses the idea
   that something irritating or shocking often happened in the past. The concept is very similar to
   the expression &quot;<a href="UsedTo.html">used to</a>&quot; but with negative emotion. Remember to put
   the words &quot;always&quot; or &quot;constantly&quot; between &quot;be&quot; and &quot;verb+ing.&quot;
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>She <strong>was always coming</strong> to class late.</li>
  <li>He <strong>was constantly talking</strong>. He annoyed everyone.</li>
  <li>I didn't like them because they <strong>were always complaining</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>While vs. When</h3>
<p>Clauses are groups of words which have meaning, but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses begin
   with the word &quot;when&quot; such as &quot;when she called&quot; or &quot;when it bit me.&quot; Other
   clauses begin with &quot;while&quot; such as &quot;while she was sleeping&quot; and &quot;while he was
   surfing.&quot; When you talk about things in the past, &quot;when&quot; is most often followed by
   the verb tense <a href="SimplePast.html">Simple Past</a>, whereas &quot;while&quot; is usually followed by
   Past Continuous. &quot;While&quot; expresses the idea of &quot;during that time.&quot; Study the examples below.
   They have  similar meanings, but they emphasize different parts of the sentence.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I was studying <strong>when she called</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>While I was studying</strong>, she called.</li>
</ul>

<h3>REMEMBER Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs</h3>
<p>It is important to remember that <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Non-Continuous Verbs</a> cannot be used in
   any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Mixed Verbs</a>
   cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Past Continuous with these verbs, you must
   use <a href="SimplePast.html">Simple Past</a>.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jane <strong>was being</strong> at my house when you arrived. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>Jane <strong>was</strong> at my house when you arrived. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>ADVERB PLACEMENT</h3>
<p>The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You were <strong>just</strong> studying when she called.</li>
  <li>Were you <strong>just</strong> studying when she called?</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACTIVE / PASSIVE</h3>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The salesman <strong>was helping</strong> the customer when the thief came into the store. <em class="comment">Active</em></li>
  <li>The customer <strong>was being helped</strong> by the salesman when the thief came into the store. <em class="comment">Passive</em></li>
