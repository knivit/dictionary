<h1>Types of Verbs</h1>

<p>Before you begin the verb tense lessons, it is extremely important to understand that
   NOT all English verbs are the same. English verbs are divided into three groups:
   Normal Verbs, Non-Continuous Verbs, and Mixed Verbs.
</p>

<h3>1. Normal Verbs</h3>
<p>Most verbs are &quot;Normal Verbs.&quot; These verbs are usually physical actions which 
   you can see somebody doing. These verbs can be used in all tenses.
</p>

<h4>Normal Verbs</h4>
<p>to run, to walk, to eat, to fly, to go, to say, to touch, etc.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>eat</strong> dinner every day.</li>
  <li>I <strong>am eating</strong> dinner now.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Non-Continuous Verbs</h3>
<p>The second group, called &quot;Non-Continuous Verbs,&quot; is smaller. These verbs are usually 
    things you cannot see somebody doing. These verbs are rarely used in continuous tenses. They include:
</p>

<h4>Abstract Verbs</h4>
<p>to be, to want, to cost, to seem, to need, to care, to contain, to owe, to exist...</p>

<h4>Possession Verbs</h4>
<p>to possess, to own, to belong...</p>

<h4>Emotion Verbs</h4>
<p>to like, to love, to hate, to dislike, to fear, to envy, to mind...</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>He <strong>is needing</strong> help now. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>He <strong>needs</strong> help now. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>He <strong>is wanting</strong> a drink now. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>He <strong>wants</strong> a drink now. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Mixed Verbs</h3>
<p> The third group, called &quot;Mixed Verbs,&quot; is the smallest group. These verbs have more
    than one meaning. In a way, each meaning is a unique verb. Some meanings behave like
    &quot;Non-Continuous Verbs,&quot; while other meanings behave like &quot;Normal Verbs.&quot;
</p>
<h4>Mixed Verbs</h4>
<p>to appear, to feel, to have, to hear, to look, to see, to weigh... </p>

    <em class="comment">Joe is behaving very formally. Usually he is not formal.</em>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>NOTICE: Only rarely is &quot;to be&quot; used in a continuous form. This is most commonly done when a person is temporarily 
   behaving badly or stereotypically. It can also be used when someone's behavior is noticeably different.
</p>
<p>to feel:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The massage <strong>feels</strong> great. <em class="label">Non-Continuous Verb</em><br>
    <em class="comment">The massage has a pleasing feeling</em>.</li>
  <li>I <strong>don't feel </strong>well today. <em class="label">Sometimes used as Non-Continuous Verb</em><br>
      <em class="comment">I am a little sick.</em><br>
        I <strong>am not feeling</strong> well today.
      <em class="label">Sometimes used as Normal Verb</em><br>
    <em class="comment">I am a little sick.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>NOTICE: The second meaning of &quot;feel&quot; is very flexible and there is no real difference in 
   meaning between &quot;I don't feel well today&quot; and &quot;I am not feeling well today.&quot;
