<h1>Future Perfect Continuous</h1>

<p>Future Perfect Continuous has two different forms: "will have been doing " and "be going to have been doing." Unlike
   <a href="SimpleFuture.html">Simple Future</a> forms, Future Perfect Continuous forms are usually
   interchangeable.
</p>

<h3>FORM Future Perfect Continuous with &quot;Will&quot; </h3>
<p>[will have been + present participle]</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You <strong>will have been waiting</strong> for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.</li>
  <li><strong>Will</strong> you <strong>have been waiting</strong> for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives?</li>
  <li>You <strong>will not have been waiting</strong> for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.</li>
</ul>

<h3>FORM Future Perfect Continuous with &quot;Be Going To&quot;</h3>
<p>[am/is/are + going to have been + present participle]</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You <strong>are going to have been waiting</strong> for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.</li>
  <li><strong>Are</strong> you <strong>going to have been waiting</strong> for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives?</li>
  <li>You <strong>are not going to have been waiting</strong> for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: It is possible to use either &quot;will&quot; or &quot;be going to&quot; to create the Future Perfect Continuous
   with little or no difference in meaning.

<h3>USE 1 Duration Before Something in the Future </h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/FuturePerfectContinuous.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>We use the Future Perfect Continuous to show that something will continue up until a particular event or time in the
   future. &quot;For five minutes,&quot; &quot;for two weeks,&quot; and &quot;since Friday&quot; are all durations which
   can be used with the Future Perfect Continuous. Notice that this is related to the
   <a href="PresentPerfectContinuous.html">Present Perfect Continuous</a> and the
   <a href="PastPerfectContinuous.html">Past Perfect Continuous</a>; however, with Future Perfect
   Continuous, the duration stops at or before a reference point in the future.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They <strong>will have been talking</strong> for over an hour by the time Thomas <em class="italics">arrives</em>.</li>
  <li>She <strong>is going to have been working</strong> at that company for three years when it finally <em class="italics">closes</em>.</li>
  <li>James <strong>will have been teaching</strong> at the university for more than a year by the time he <em class="italics">leaves</em> for Asia.</li>
  <li>How long <strong>will</strong> you <strong>have been studying</strong> when you <em class="italics">graduate</em>?</li>
  <li>We <strong>are going to have been driving</strong> for over three days straight when we <em class="italics">get</em> to Anchorage. </li>
  <li>A: When you <em class="italics">finish</em> your English course, <strong>will</strong> you <strong>have been living</strong> in New Zealand for over a year?<br>
      B: No, I <strong>will not have been living</strong> here that long. </li>
</ul>

<p>Notice in the examples above that the reference points (<em class="italics">marked in italics</em>) are  in
   <a href="SimplePresent.html">Simple Present</a> rather than
   <a href="SimpleFuture.html">Simple Future</a>. This is because these future events are  in
   <a href="SimpleFuture.html#tc">time clauses</a>, and you cannot use future tenses in time clauses.
</p>

<h3>USE 2 Cause of Something in the Future</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/FuturePerfectContinuous.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>Using the Future Perfect Continuous before another action in the future is a good way to show cause and effect.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jason will be tired when he gets home because he <strong>will have been jogging</strong> for over an hour.</li>
  <li>Claudia's English will be perfect when she returns to Germany because she <strong>is going to have been studying</strong> English in the United States for over two years.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Continuous vs. Future Perfect Continuous </h3>
<p>If you do not include a duration such as "for five minutes," "for two weeks" or "since Friday," many English speakers
   choose to use the Future Continuous rather than the Future Perfect Continuous. Be careful because this can change
   the meaning of the sentence. Future Continuous emphasizes interrupted actions, whereas Future Perfect Continuous
   emphasizes a duration of time before something in the future. Study the examples below to understand the difference.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>He will be tired because he <strong>will be exercising</strong> so hard.<br>
    <em class="comment">This sentence emphasizes that he will be tired because he will be exercising at that exact moment in the future. </em>
  </li>
  <li>He will be tired because he <strong>will have been exercising</strong> so hard.<br>
    <em class="comment">This sentence emphasizes that he will be tired because he will have been exercising for a period of time. It is possible that he will still be exercising at that moment OR that he will just have finished.</em><br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>REMEMBER No Future in Time Clauses</h3>
<p>Like all future forms, the Future Perfect Continuous cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as:
   when, while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of Future Perfect Continuous,
   <a href="PresentPerfectContinuous.html">Present Perfect Continuous</a> is used.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You won't get a promotion until you <strong>will have been working</strong> here as long as Tim. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>You won't get a promotion until you <strong>have been working</strong> here as long as Tim. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>AND REMEMBER Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs</h3>
<p>It is important to remember that <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Non-Continuous Verbs</a> cannot be
   used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for
   <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Mixed Verbs</a> cannot be used in continuous tenses.
   Instead of using Future Perfect Continuous with these verbs, you must use
   <a href="FuturePerfect.html">Future Perfect </a>.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ned <strong>will </strong><strong>have been having </strong> his driver's license for over two years.
    <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em>
  </li>
  <li>Ned <strong>will </strong><strong>have had </strong> his driver's license for over two years.
    <em class="correct">Correct</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>ADVERB PLACEMENT</h3>
<p>The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will <strong>only</strong> have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives.</li>
  <li>Will you <strong>only</strong> have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>You are <strong>only</strong> going to have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives.</li>
  <li>Are you <strong>only</strong> going to have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives?</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACTIVE / PASSIVE</h3>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The famous artist <strong>will have been painting</strong> the mural for over six months by the time it is finished.
    <em class="comment">Active</em>
  </li>
  <li>The mural <strong>will have been being painted</strong> by the famous artist for over six months by the time it is finished.
    <em class="comment">Passive</em>
  </li>

    <em class="comment">Passive</em>

</ul>
