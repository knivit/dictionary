<h3>USE 1 Completed Action Before Something in the Past</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/PastPerfect.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>The Past Perfect expresses the idea that something occurred before another action in the past. It can also show that
   something happened before a specific time in the past.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>had</strong> never <strong>seen</strong> such a beautiful beach before I went to Kauai.</li>
  <li>I did not have any money because I <strong>had lost</strong> my wallet.</li>
  <li>Tony knew Istanbul so well because he <strong>had visited</strong> the city several times.</li>
  <li><strong>Had</strong> Susan ever <strong>studied</strong> Thai before she moved to Thailand?</li>
  <li>She only understood the movie because she <strong>had read</strong> the book.</li>
  <li>Kristine <strong>had</strong> never <strong>been</strong> to an opera before last night.</li>
  <li>We were not able to get a hotel room because we <strong>had not booked</strong> in advance. </li>
  <li>A: <strong>Had</strong> you ever <strong>visited</strong> the U.S. before your trip in 2006?<br>
      B: Yes, I <strong>had been</strong> to the U.S. once before.</li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 2 Duration Before Something in the Past (Non-Continuous Verbs)</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/PastPerfectContinuous.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>With <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Non-Continuous Verbs</a> and some non-continuous uses of
   <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Mixed Verbs</a>, we use the Past Perfect to show that something
   started in the past and continued up until another action in the past.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We <strong>had had</strong> that car for ten years before it broke down.</li>
  <li>By the time Alex finished his studies, he <strong>had been</strong> in London for over eight years.</li>
  <li>They felt bad about selling the house because they <strong>had owned</strong> it for more than forty years.</li>
</ul>

Although the above use of Past Perfect is normally limited to Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs,
the words &quot;live,&quot; &quot;work,&quot; &quot;teach,&quot; and &quot;study&quot; are sometimes used in this way
even though they are NOT Non-Continuous Verbs.

<h3>IMPORTANT Specific Times with the Past Perfect</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/SimplePastSpecific.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>Unlike with the <a href="PresentPerfect.html">Present Perfect</a>, it is possible to use specific
   time words or phrases with the Past Perfect. Although this is possible, it is usually not necessary.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>She <strong>had visited</strong> her Japanese relatives once in 1993 before she moved in with them in 1996.</li>
</ul>

<h4>MOREOVER</h4>
<p>If the Past Perfect action did occur at a specific time, the Simple Past can be used instead of the Past Perfect when
   &quot;before&quot; or &quot;after&quot; is used in the sentence. The words &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;
   actually tell you what happens first, so the Past Perfect is optional. For this reason, both sentences below are correct.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>She <strong>had visited</strong> her Japanese relatives once in 1993 before she moved in with them in 1996.</li>
  <li>She <strong>visited</strong> her Japanese relatives once in 1993 before she moved in with them in 1996.</li>
</ul>

<h4>HOWEVER</h4>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/PastPerfect.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>If the Past Perfect is not referring to an action at a specific time, Past Perfect is not optional. Compare the examples
   below. Here Past Perfect is referring to a lack of experience rather than an action at a specific time. For this reason,
   Simple Past cannot be used.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>She never <strong>saw</strong> a bear before she moved to Alaska. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>She <strong>had</strong> never <strong>seen</strong> a bear before she moved to Alaska. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>ADVERB PLACEMENT</h3>
<p>The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You had <strong>previously</strong> studied English before you moved to New York. </li>
  <li>Had you <strong>previously</strong> studied English before you moved to New York?</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACTIVE / PASSIVE </h3>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>George <strong>had repaired</strong> many cars before he received his mechanic's license. <em class="comment">Active</em></li>
  <li>Many cars <strong>had been repaired</strong> by George before he received his mechanic's license. <em class="comment">Passive</em></li>
</ul>
