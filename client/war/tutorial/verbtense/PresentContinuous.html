   something is happening now, at this very moment. It can also be used to show that something is not
   happening now.
</p>

<p><img src="tutorial/images/PresentContinuousLongNow.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>In English, &quot;now&quot; can mean: this second, today, this month, this year, this century, and so on.
    Sometimes, we use the Present Continuous to say that we are in the process of doing a longer action
    which is in progress; however, we might not be doing it at this exact second.
</p>
<p>Examples: (All of these sentences can be said while eating dinner in a restaurant.)</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>am studying</strong> to become a doctor.</li>
  <li>I <strong>am not studying</strong> to become a dentist.</li>

  <li>I <strong>am not reading</strong> any books right now.</li>
  <li><strong>Are</strong> you <strong>working</strong> on any special projects at work?</li>

</ul>

<ul>

  <li>I <strong>am not going</strong> to the party tonight.</li>
  <li><strong>Is</strong> he <strong>visiting</strong> his parents next weekend?</li>

<p><img src="tutorial/images/SimplePresentUsual.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>The Present Continuous with words such as &quot;always&quot; or &quot;constantly&quot; expresses the idea
   that something irritating or shocking often happens. Notice that the meaning is like
   <a href="SimplePresent.html">Simple Present</a>, but with negative emotion. Remember to put
   the words &quot;always&quot; or &quot;constantly&quot; between &quot;be&quot; and &quot;verb+ing.&quot;
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>She <strong>is always coming</strong> to class late.</li>
  <li>He <strong>is constantly talking</strong>. I wish he would shut up.</li>
  <li>I don't like them because they <strong>are always complaining</strong>.</li>
</ul>
