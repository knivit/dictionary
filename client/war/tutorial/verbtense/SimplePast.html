<h3>USE 1 Completed Action in the Past</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/SimplePast.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>Use the Simple Past to express the idea that an action started and finished at a specific time in the past.
   Sometimes, the speaker may not actually mention the specific time, but they do have one specific time in mind.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>saw</strong> a movie yesterday.</li>
  <li>I <strong>didn't see</strong> a play yesterday.</li>
  <li>Last year, I <strong>traveled</strong> to Japan.</li>
  <li>Last year, I <strong>didn't travel</strong> to Korea.</li>
  <li><strong>Did</strong> you <strong>have</strong> dinner last night? </li>
  <li>She <strong>washed</strong> her car.</li>
  <li>He <strong>didn't wash</strong> his car.</li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 2 A Series of Completed Actions</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/SimplePastSeries.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>We use the Simple Past to list a series of completed actions in the past. These actions happen 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and so on. </p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>finished</strong> work, <strong>walked</strong> to the beach, and <strong>found</strong> a nice place to swim.</li>
  <li>He <strong>arrived</strong> from the airport at 8:00, <strong>checked</strong> into the hotel at 9:00, and <strong>met</strong> the others at 10:00.</li>
  <li><strong>Did</strong> you <strong>add</strong> flour, <strong>pour</strong> in the milk, and then <strong>add</strong> the eggs? </li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 3 Duration in Past</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/SimplePastDuration.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>The Simple Past can be used with a duration which starts and stops in the past. A duration is a longer
   action often indicated by expressions such as: for two years, for five minutes, all day, all year, etc.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>lived</strong> in Brazil for two years.</li>
  <li>Shauna <strong>studied</strong> Japanese for five years.</li>
  <li>They <strong>sat</strong> at the beach all day.</li>
  <li>They <strong>did not stay</strong> at the party the entire time. </li>
  <li>We <strong>talked</strong> on the phone for thirty minutes.</li>
  <li>A: How long <strong>did</strong> you <strong>wait</strong> for them?<br>
      B: We <strong>waited</strong> for one hour.</li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 4 Habits in the Past</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/SimplePastHabit.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>The Simple Past can also be used to describe a habit which stopped in the past. It can have the same
   meaning as &quot;<a href="UsedTo.html">used to</a>.&quot; To make it clear that we are talking about
   a habit, we often add expressions such as: always, often, usually, never, when I was a child,
   when I was younger, etc.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>studied</strong> French when I was a child.</li>
  <li>He <strong>played</strong> the violin.</li>
  <li>He <strong>didn't play</strong> the piano. </li>
  <li><strong>Did</strong> you <strong>play</strong> a musical instrument when you were a kid? </li>
  <li>She <strong>worked</strong> at the movie theater after school.</li>
  <li>They never <strong>went</strong> to school, they always <strong>skipped</strong> class.</li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 5 Past Facts or Generalizations</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/SimplePastFact.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>The Simple Past can also be used to describe past facts or generalizations which are no longer true.
   As in USE 4 above, this use of the Simple Past is quite similar to the expression
   &quot;<a href="UsedTo.html">used to</a>.&quot;
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>She <strong>was</strong> shy as a child, but now she is very outgoing.</li>
  <li>He <strong>didn't like</strong> tomatoes before. </li>
  <li><strong>Did</strong> you <strong>live</strong> in Texas when you <strong>were</strong> a kid?</li>
  <li>People <strong>paid</strong> much more to make cell phone calls in the past. </li>
</ul>

<h3>IMPORTANT When-Clauses Happen First</h3>
<p>Clauses are groups of words which have meaning but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses begin
   with the word &quot;when&quot; such as &quot;when I dropped my pen...&quot; or &quot;when class began...&quot;
   These clauses are called when-clauses, and they are very important. The examples below contain when-clauses.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>When I paid her one dollar</strong>, she answered my question.</li>
  <li>She answered my question <strong>when I paid her one dollar</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When-clauses are important because they always happen first when both clauses are in the Simple Past.
   Both of the examples above mean the same thing: first, I paid her one dollar, and then, she answered
   my question. It is not important whether &quot;when I paid her one dollar&quot; is at the beginning
   of the sentence or at the end of the sentence. However, the example below has a different meaning.
   First, she answered my question, and then, I paid her one dollar.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I paid her one dollar <strong>when she answered my question</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ADVERB PLACEMENT</h3>
<p>The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You <strong>just</strong> called Debbie.</li>
  <li>Did you <strong>just</strong> call Debbie?</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACTIVE / PASSIVE</h3>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tom <strong>repaired</strong> the car. <em class="comment">Active</em></li>
  <li>The car <strong>was repaired</strong> by Tom. <em class="comment">Passive</em></li>
</ul>
