<h1>Future Perfect</h1>

<p>Future Perfect has two different forms: "will have done" and "be going to have done." Unlike
   <a href="SimpleFuture.html">Simple Future</a> forms, Future Perfect forms are usually interchangeable.
</p>

<h3>FORM Future Perfect with &quot;Will&quot;</h3>
<p>[will have + past participle]</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You <strong>will have perfected</strong> your English by the time you come back from the U.S.</li>
  <li><strong>Will</strong> you <strong>have perfected</strong> your English by the time you come back from the U.S.?</li>
  <li>You <strong>will not have perfected</strong> your English by the time you come back from the U.S.</li>
</ul>

<h3>FORM Future Perfect with &quot;Be Going To&quot;</h3>
<p>[am/is/are + going to have + past participle]</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You <strong>are going to have perfected</strong> your English by the time you come back from the U.S.</li>
  <li><strong>Are</strong> you <strong>going to have perfected</strong> your English by the time you come back from the U.S.?</li>
  <li>You <strong>are not going to have perfected</strong> your English by the time you come back from the U.S.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: It is possible to use either &quot;will&quot; or &quot;be going to&quot; to create the Future Perfect with little
   or no difference in meaning.

<h3>USE 1 Completed Action Before Something in the Future</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/FuturePerfect.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>The Future Perfect expresses the idea that something will occur before another action in the future. It can also show
   that something will happen before a specific time in the future.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By next November, I <strong>will have received</strong> my promotion.</li>
  <li>By the time he <em class="italics">gets</em> home, she <strong>is going to have cleaned</strong> the entire house.</li>
  <li>I <strong>am not going to have finished</strong> this test by 3 o'clock.</li>
  <li><strong>Will</strong> she <strong>have learned</strong> enough Chinese to communicate before she
    <em class="italics">moves</em> to Beijing?
  </li>
  <li>Sam <strong>is</strong> probably <strong>going to have completed</strong> the proposal by the time he
    <em class="italics">leaves</em> this afternoon.
  </li>
  <li>By the time I <em class="italics">finish</em> this course, I <strong>will have taken</strong> ten tests. </li>
  <li>How many countries <strong>are</strong> you <strong>going to have visited</strong> by the time you
    <em class="italics">turn</em> 50?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Notice in the examples above that the reference points (<em class="italics">marked in italics</em>) are  in
   <a href="SimplePresent.html">Simple Present</a> rather than
   <a href="SimpleFuture.html">Simple Future</a>. This is because the interruptions are  in
   <a href="SimpleFuture.html#tc">time clauses</a>, and you cannot use future tenses in time clauses.
</p>

<h3>USE 2 Duration Before Something in the Future (Non-Continuous Verbs)</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/FuturePerfectContinuous.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>With <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Non-Continuous Verbs</a> and some non-continuous uses of
   <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Mixed Verbs</a>, we use the Future Perfect to show that something will
   continue up until another action in the future.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>will have been</strong> in London for six months by the time I leave.</li>
  <li>By Monday, Susan <strong>is going to have had</strong> my book for a week.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the above use of Future Perfect is normally limited to Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed
   Verbs, the words &quot;live,&quot; &quot;work,&quot; &quot;teach,&quot; and &quot;study&quot; are sometimes used in
   this way even though they are NOT Non-Continuous Verbs.
</p>

<h3>REMEMBER No Future in Time Clauses</h3>
<p>Like all future forms, the Future Perfect cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when,
   while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of Future Perfect,
   <a href="PresentPerfect.html">Present Perfect</a> is used.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I am going to see a movie when I <strong>will have finished</strong> my homework. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>I am going to see a movie when I <strong>have finished</strong> my homework. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>ADVERB PLACEMENT</h3>
<p>The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will <strong>only</strong>  have learned a few words.</li>
  <li>Will you <strong>only</strong> have learned a few words?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>You are <strong>only</strong> going to have learned a few words.</li>
  <li>Are you <strong>only</strong> going to have learned a few words?</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACTIVE / PASSIVE</h3>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They <strong>will have completed</strong> the project before the deadline. <em class="comment">Active</em></li>
  <li>The project <strong>will have been completed</strong> before the deadline. <em class="comment">Passive</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>They <strong>are going to have completed</strong> the project before the deadline. <em class="comment">Active</em></li>
  <li>The project <strong>is going to have been completed</strong> before the deadline. <em class="comment">Passive</em></li>
</ul>
