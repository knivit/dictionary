<h1>Future Continuous</h1>

<p>Future Continuous has two different forms: "will be doing " and "be going to be doing." Unlike
   <a href="SimpleFuture.html">Simple Future</a> forms, Future Continuous forms are usually
   interchangeable.
</p>

<h3>FORM Future Continuous with &quot;Will&quot;</h3>
<p>[will  be + present participle]</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You <strong>will be waiting</strong> for her when her plane arrives tonight.</li>
  <li><strong>Will</strong> you <strong>be waiting</strong> for her when her plane arrives tonight?</li>
  <li>You <strong>will not be waiting</strong> for her when her plane arrives tonight.</li>
</ul>

<h3>FORM Future Continuous with &quot;Be Going To &quot;</h3>
<p>[am/is/are + going to be + present participle]</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You <strong>are going to be waiting</strong> for her when her plane arrives tonight.</li>
  <li><strong>Are</strong> you <strong>going to be waiting</strong> for her when her plane arrives tonight?</li>
  <li>You <strong>are not going to be waiting</strong> for her when her plane arrives tonight.</li>
</ul>

<p>REMEMBER: It is possible to use either &quot;will&quot; or &quot;be going to&quot; to create the Future Continuous
   with little  difference in meaning.

<h3>USE 1 Interrupted Action in the Future</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/FutureContinuous.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>Use the Future Continuous to indicate that a longer action in the future will be interrupted by a shorter action
   in the future.   Remember this can be a real interruption or just an interruption in time.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>will be watching</strong> TV when she <em class="italics">arrives</em> tonight.</li>
  <li>I <strong>will be waiting</strong> for you when your bus <em class="italics">arrives</em>.</li>
  <li>I <strong>am going to be staying</strong> at the Madison Hotel, if anything <em class="italics">happens</em> and you <em class="italics">need</em> to contact me.</li>
  <li>He <strong>will be studying</strong> at the library tonight, so he will not see Jennifer when she <em class="italics">arrives</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice in the examples above that the interruptions (<em class="italics">marked in italics</em>) are in
   <a href="SimplePresent.html">Simple Present</a> rather than
   <a href="SimpleFuture.html">Simple Future</a>. This is because the interruptions are in
   <a href="#tc">time clauses</a>, and you cannot use future tenses in time clauses.
</p>

<h3>USE 2 Specific Time as an Interruption in the Future</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/FutureContinuous.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>In USE 1, described above, the Future Continuous is interrupted by a short action in the future. In addition to using
   short actions as interruptions, you can also use a specific time as an interruption.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tonight at 6 PM, I <strong>am going to be eating</strong> dinner.<br>
    <em class="comment">I will be in the process of eating dinner. </em>
  </li>
  <li>At midnight tonight, we <strong>will</strong> still <strong>be driving</strong> through the desert.<br>
    <em class="comment">We will be in the process of driving through the desert. </em>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>REMEMBER</h4>
<p>In the Simple Future, a specific time is used to show the time an action will begin or end. In the Future Continuous,
   a specific time  interrupts the action.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tonight at 6 PM, I <strong>am going to eat</strong> dinner.<br>
    <em class="comment">I am going to start eating at 6 PM.</em>
  </li>
  <li>Tonight at 6 PM, I <strong>am going to be eating</strong> dinner.<br>
    <em class="comment">I am going to start earlier and I will be in the process of eating dinner at 6 PM.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 3 Parallel Actions in the Future</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/FutureContinuousParallel.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>When you use the Future Continuous with two actions in the same sentence, it expresses the idea that both actions
   will be happening at the same time. The actions are parallel.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>am going to be studying</strong> and he <strong>is going to be making</strong> dinner.</li>
  <li>Tonight, they <strong>will be eating</strong> dinner, <strong>discussing</strong> their plans, and <strong>having</strong> a good time.</li>
  <li>While Ellen
    <em class="italics">is reading</em>, Tim <strong>will be watching</strong> television.<br>
    <em class="comment">Notice "is reading" because of the time clause containing "while."
      <a href="#tc2">(See Explanation Below</a>)
    </em>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 4 Atmosphere in the Future</h3>
<p>In English, we often use a series of Parallel Actions to describe atmosphere at a specific point in the future.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When I arrive at the party, everybody <strong>is going to be celebrating</strong>. Some <strong>will be dancing</strong>. Others <strong>are going to be talking</strong>. A few people <strong>will be eating</strong> pizza, and several people <strong>are going to be drinking</strong> beer. They always do the same thing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>REMEMBER No Future in Time Clauses<a name="tc2"></a></h3>
<p>Like all future tenses, the Future Continuous cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when,
   while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of Future Continuous,
   <a href="PresentContinuous.html">Present Continuous</a> is used.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>While I <strong>am going to be finishing</strong> my homework, she is going to make dinner. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>While I <strong>am finishing</strong> my homework, she is going to make dinner. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>AND REMEMBER Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs</h3>
<p>It is important to remember that <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Non-Continuous Verbs</a> cannot be
   used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for
   <a href="TypesOfVerbs.html">Mixed Verbs</a> cannot be used in continuous tenses.
   Instead of using Future Continuous with these verbs, you must use
   <a href="SimpleFuture.html">Simple Future</a>.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jane <strong>will be being</strong> at my house when you arrive. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
  <li>Jane <strong>will be</strong> at my house when you arrive. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>ADVERB PLACEMENT</h3>
<p>The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will <strong>still</strong> be  waiting for her when her plane arrives.</li>
  <li>Will you <strong>still</strong> be waiting for her when her plane arrives?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>You are <strong>still</strong> going to be waiting for her when her plane arrives.</li>
  <li>Are you <strong>still</strong> going to be waiting for her when her plane arrives?</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACTIVE / PASSIVE </h3>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At 8:00 PM tonight, John <strong>will be washing</strong> the dishes. <em class="comment">Active</em></li>
  <li>At 8:00 PM tonight, the dishes <strong>will be being washed</strong> by John. <em class="comment">Passive</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>At 8:00 PM tonight, John <strong>is going to be washing</strong> the dishes. <em class="comment">Active</em></li>
  <li>At 8:00 PM tonight, the dishes <strong>are going to be being washed</strong> by John. <em class="comment">Passive</em></li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: Passive forms of the Future Continuous are not common.</p>
