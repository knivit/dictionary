<h3>USE 1 Habit in the Past </h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/SimplePastHabit.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""></p>
<p>Like &quot;<a href="UsedYo.html">used to</a>&quot; and
   <a href="SimplePast.html">Simple Past</a>, &quot;would always&quot; expresses the idea that something
   was an old habit which stopped in the past. It says that an action was often repeated in the past, but it is not usually
   done now. Unlike &quot;used to&quot; and Simple Past, &quot;would always&quot; suggests that someone willingly acted that
   way and sometimes expresses annoyance or amusement at the habit. It also often suggests the habit was extreme. To express
   the opposite idea, we can  say &quot;would never&quot; to indicate that someone never did something in the past, but now
   they do.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>She <strong>would always send</strong> me strange birthday gifts.</li>
  <li>Sam and Mary <strong>would always choose</strong> the most exotic vacation destinations.</li>
  <li>Sally <strong>would not always arrive</strong> early to class. She came late once or twice. </li>
  <li>Ned <strong>would always show</strong> up at our house without calling first.</li>
  <li>Mindy <strong>would not always walk</strong> to school. Sometimes, she took the bus. </li>
  <li>Christine <strong>would always come</strong> late to the meetings.</li>
  <li>Jeff <strong>would never pay</strong> for drinks when we went out together with our friends.<br>
    <em class="comment">Refusing to do something or normally not doing something is also a form of habit.</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>REMEMBER &quot;Would Always&quot; is Different</h3>
<p>&quot;Would always&quot; is not exactly the same as &quot;
   <a href="UsedTo.html">used to</a>&quot; or the
   <a href="SimplePast.html">Simple Past</a>. &quot;Would always&quot; cannot be used to talk about
   past facts or generalizations. It can only be used for repeated actions.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sarah <strong>was</strong> shy, but now she is very outgoing. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
  <li>Sarah <strong>used to be</strong> shy, but now she is very outgoing. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>
  <li>Sarah <strong>would always be</strong> shy, but now she is very outgoing. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Forms Related to &quot;Would Always&quot;</h3>
<p>In addition to &quot;would always,&quot; English speakers often use &quot;would constantly,&quot; &quot;would often,&quot;
   &quot;would forever&quot; or simply &quot;would.&quot; Although the last form &quot;would&quot; is correct, it is not
   suggested because it can easily be confused with other verb forms such as the
   <a href="ConditionalIntro.html">Conditional</a> or
   <a href="FutureInPast.html">Future in the Past</a>. Similarly, speakers can use &quot;would rarely,
   &quot; &quot;would occasionally&quot; and  &quot;would seldom&quot; to express the idea that an action was not often
   repeated.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jerry <strong>would come</strong> to the parties every weekend. </li>
  <li>Jerry <strong>would constantly bring</strong> his girlfriend to the parties. </li>
  <li>Jerry <strong>would often bring</strong> his best friend to the parties. </li>
  <li>Jerry <strong>would occasionally bring</strong> his older brother to the parties. </li>
  <li>Jerry <strong>would seldom bring</strong> his sister to the parties. </li>
  <li>Jerry <strong>would never bring</strong> his younger brother to the parties.</li>
</ul>
