<h3>FORM</h3>
<p>[used to + VERB]</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>used to go</strong> to the beach every day.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is better not to use "used to" in questions or negative forms; however, this is sometimes done in informal spoken English.
   It is better to ask questions and create negative sentences using
   <a href="SimplePast.html">Simple Past</a>.
</p>
<h3>USE 1 Habit in the Past</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/SimplePastHabit.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""> </p>
<p>&quot;Used to&quot; expresses the idea that something was an old habit that stopped in the past. It indicates that something
   was often repeated in the past, but it is not usually done now.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jerry <strong>used to study</strong> English.</li>
  <li>Sam and Mary <strong>used to go</strong> to Mexico in the summer.</li>
  <li>I <strong>used to start</strong> work at 9 o'clock.</li>
  <li>Christine <strong>used to eat</strong> meat, but now she is a vegetarian.</li>
</ul>

<h3>USE 2 Past Facts and Generalizations</h3>
<p><img src="tutorial/images/SimplePastFact.gif" width="258" height="50" alt=""> </p>
<p>&quot;Used to&quot; can also be used to talk about past facts or generalizations which are no longer true.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I <strong>used to live</strong> in Paris.</li>
  <li>Sarah <strong>used to be fat</strong>, but now she is thin.</li>
  <li>George <strong>used to be</strong> the best student in class, but now Lena is the best.</li>
  <li>Oranges <strong>used to cost</strong> very little in Florida, but now they are quite expensive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Used to&quot; vs. Simple Past</h3>
<p>Both <a href="SimplePast.html">Simple Past</a> and &quot;Used to&quot; can be used to describe past habits,
   past facts and past generalizations; however, &quot;used to&quot; is preferred when emphasizing these forms of past repetition
   in positive sentences. On the other hand, when asking questions or making negative sentences,
   <a href="SimplePast.html">Simple Past</a> is preferred.
</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You <strong>used to play</strong> the piano.</li>
  <li><strong>Did</strong> you <strong>play</strong> the piano when you were young?</li>
  <li>You <strong>did not play</strong> the piano when you were young.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACTIVE / PASSIVE</h3>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jerry <strong>used to pay</strong> the bills. <em class="comment">Active</em></li>
  <li>The bills <strong>used to be paid</strong> by Jerry. <em class="comment">Passive</em></li>
</ul>
