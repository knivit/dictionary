<h1>Gerunds and Infinitives Part 3 </h1>
<p>13. Some verbs can be followed by a gerund or an infinitive, but with a difference in meaning. <a href="gerund_or_infinitive_different_list.htm">List of Verbs Followed by a Gerund or Infinitive (Different Meaning)</a></p>
<div class="ex">
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nancy <strong>remembered</strong> <strong>getting</strong> married.<em class="comment"> Nancy has a memory of getting married. </em></li>
    <li>Fred <strong>remembered</strong> <strong>to bring</strong> sunblock to the beach. <em class="comment">Fred remembered that he needed to bring sunblock. </em></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>14. Some verbs can be followed by a gerund or an infinitive with little difference in meaning. <a href="gerund_or_infinitive_same_list.htm">List of Verbs Followed by a Gerund or Infinitive (Similar Meaning)</a></p>
<div class="ex">
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>She <strong>likes</strong> <strong>swimming</strong>.</li>
    <li>She <strong>likes</strong> <strong>to swim</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Although the difference in meaning is small with these particular verbs, and gerunds and infinitives can often be used interchangeably, there is still a meaning difference. Using a gerund suggests that you are referring to real activities or experiences. Using an infinitive suggests that you are talking about potential or possible activities or experiences. Because of this small difference in meaning, gerunds and infinitives cannot always be used interchangeably, such as in the examples below. </p>
<div class="ex">
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The British reporter <strong>likes</strong> <strong>living</strong> in New York. <em class="comment">He lives in New York and he likes what he experiences there.</em></li>
    <li>The British reporter <strong>likes</strong> <strong>to live</strong> in New York whenever he works in the United States. <em class="comment">He likes the option or possibility of living in New York when he works in the United States.</em></li>
	<li>I <strong>like speaking</strong> French because it's such a beautiful language. <em class="comment">I like the experience of speaking French, and the way it makes me feel when I speak the language.</em></li>
    <li>I <strong>like to speak</strong> French when I'm in France. <em class="comment">I prefer the option of speaking French when I am in France.</em></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>15. There are many "be + adjective" combinations that are commonly followed by infinitives. <a href="adjective_infinitive_list.htm">List of Be + Adjective Combinations Followed by Infinitives</a></p>
<div class="ex">
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They <strong>were anxious</strong> <strong>to begin</strong>.</li>
    <li>She <strong>was delighted</strong> <strong>to receive</strong> such good feedback.</li>
    <li>He <strong>is lucky</strong> <strong>to have</strong> such good friends.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>16. There are also many nouns that are commonly followed by infinitives. <a href="noun_infinitive_list.htm">List of Nouns Followed by Infinitives</a></p>
<div class="ex">
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It was a good <strong>decision</strong> <strong>to move</strong> to San Francisco.</li>
    <li>His <strong>wish</strong> <strong>to become</strong> an actor was well known.</li>
    <li>Laura's <strong>desire</strong> <strong>to improve</strong> impressed me.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>17. Sometimes infinitives are used to express the idea of "in order to do something."</p>
<div class="ex">
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>He bought the English dictionary <strong>to look up</strong> difficult words.  <em class="comment">in order to look up</em></li>
    <li>Janine sold her car <strong>to get</strong> the money that she needed. <em class="comment">in order to get</em></li>
    <li>Juan uses Englishpage.com <strong>to learn</strong> English. <em class="comment">in order to learn</em></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>This idea of "in order to do something" is found in many English patterns.</p>
<h4>too + adjective/adverb + infinitive</h4>
<div class="ex">
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The box is <strong>too</strong> <strong>heavy</strong> <strong>to carry</strong>.</li>

    <li>Fiona ran <strong>too</strong> <strong>slowly</strong> <strong>to win</strong> the race.</li>
    <li>We arrived <strong>too</strong> <strong>late</strong> <strong>to see</strong> the beginning of the movie.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h4>adjective/adverb + enough + infinitive</h4>
<div class="ex">
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>She is <strong>tall</strong> <strong>enough</strong> <strong>to reach</strong> the book on the shelf.</li>
    <li>Brian was <strong>smart</strong> <strong>enough</strong> <strong>to enter</strong> college at the age of 12.</li>

    <li>Diane needs <strong>enough</strong> <strong>time</strong> <strong>to finish</strong> writing her book.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>18. Certain expressions are followed by "ING" forms. <a href="expression_ing.htm">List of Expressions followed by Verb+ing Forms</a></p>
<div class="ex">
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>He <strong>had fun</strong> <strong>fishing</strong>.</li>
    <li>They <strong>had difficulty</strong> <strong>finding</strong> a parking place.</li>
	<li>She <strong>spent her time</strong> <strong>practicing</strong> the piano.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>19. Verbs which indicate location can often be followed by "ING" forms. This pattern is VERB OF LOCATION + LOCATION + VERB+ING.  <a href="verb_location_ing.htm">List of Verbs of Location</a></p>
<div class="ex">
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sarah <strong>stood</strong> <strong>at the corner</strong> <strong>waiting</strong> for Tom.</li>
    <li>Melissa <strong>lay</strong> <strong>in bed</strong> <strong>thinking</strong> about her future.</li>
    <li>Don <strong>clung</strong> <strong>to the side of the cliff</strong> <strong>looking</strong> down.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>20. In addition to simple gerund and infinitive forms, there are progressive gerund and infinitive forms, passive gerund and infinitive forms and perfect  gerund and infinitive forms as well as combinations of these forms. Progressive forms are used to emphasize that an action is taking place now. Passive forms are used to emphasize that the subject of the sentence is being acted upon. Perfect gerund and infinitive forms are used to emphasize completion in both the past and the future. Study the examples below to help understand these concepts.
